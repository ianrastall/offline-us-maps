"""Writes crates/offline-maps-core/src/regions_data.rs, the catalog of regions: the US states
and territories, Canada and Mexico (with --built), and the regions elsewhere that Geofabrik
publishes a Shortbread package for (with --world).

Inputs (downloaded separately; nothing here touches the network):
  index-v1.json   https://download.geofabrik.de/index-v1.json (region outlines)
  sizes.txt       "<slug> <bytes>" per line: HEAD Content-Length of <slug>-shortbread-1.0.mbtiles
  pbf-sizes.txt   "<slug> <bytes>" per line: HEAD Content-Length of <slug>-latest.osm.pbf
                  (offline-maps-dev probe <url> reports both)
  overlays-summary.json (optional) data/layer-build/out/summary.json from
                  tools/layers/build_overlays.py; regions without a built overlay file get 0
  terrain-sizes.txt "<slug> <bytes>" per line: bytes of Mapterhorn's planet.pmtiles tiles,
                  zoom 0-12, touching the region's outline box (offline-maps-dev
                  terrain-size, which reads the archive's index only)
  extract-boxes.txt "<slug> <west> <south> <east> <north>" per line: the header box of each
                  raw extract (tools/extract-boxes.py)

  built.json      (optional, --built) regions whose packages are built for the app and published
                  with its releases (tools/regions-build): a list of {id, name, source_page,
                  package_url, extras_url, package_box, outline_box, extract_box, package_bytes,
                  extras_bytes, terrain_bytes}; boxes are [west, south, east, north]
  world folder    (optional, --world) the output of tools/world-regions.py: selected.json and
                  that folder's sizes.txt, pbf-sizes.txt, terrain-sizes.txt and extract-boxes.txt
  built-world.json (optional, --world-built) packages built from to-build.json in that folder by
                  tools/regions-build/build_shortbread.py --world, published in the regions release

Usage: python -I tools/make-regions.py index-v1.json sizes.txt pbf-sizes.txt terrain-sizes.txt extract-boxes.txt <date YYYY-MM-DD> [overlays-summary.json] [--built built.json] [--world folder [--world-built built-world.json]]
       then cargo fmt

IDs: ISO 3166-2 for US states, Canadian provinces and Mexican states (us-il, ca-on, mx-que),
ISO 3166-1 for Mexico as a whole (mx). Elsewhere tools/world-regions.py assigns them.

Each region's coverage check is its outline's bounding box (Geofabrik's package
bounds equal it): the package must lie within the box widened by OUTER_MARGIN
degrees and must cover five points inside it. Geofabrik cuts the raw extracts with
boundaries that can reach further than the index outline (16 states and Mexico on
11 November 2026), so the outer box also takes in each extract's header box. Illinois keeps its hand-written
entry in package.rs. Alaska is left out: its outline crosses the 180th meridian,
so its package spans the whole width of the world (29.6 GB on 8 November 2026).
Mexico is one region (Geofabrik does not split it), with the ID mx.
