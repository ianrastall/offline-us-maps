# Implementation and validation

## Stage 1: project and core foundations

Implemented: Illinois source references, attribution constants, finite/range-checked coordinates, package readiness states and bounded streaming to caller-owned staging storage. Unit tests cover multibuffer transfers, unknown lengths, truncation, empty bodies, size limits, cancellation, write failures and readiness.

This is not an HTTP download or an offline map demonstration. The caller must supply a response reader and staging writer and validate package format separately.

Verified on Windows x64 on 27 October 2026 with Rust 1.99.1: all 8 unit tests passed; Clippy passed with warnings denied. Formatting checked with rustfmt. No dataset download or installed-app verification has been performed.

## Stage 2: renderer proof

Completed 8 November 2026; see [renderer proof](renderer-proof.md). Geofabrik's Illinois Shortbread MBTiles (362.6 MB, ODbL, zoom 0–14, 81,302 tiles) rendered in MapLibre GL JS 6.16.0 with a bundled VersaTiles 7.0.1 style, sprites and Noto Sans glyphs. All requests stayed on the loopback origin under a same-origin CSP with zero violations and zero map errors, from statewide zoom 7 to overzoomed zoom 17, in light and dark styles. No preparation step is needed: the package is directly renderable. Decision: MapLibre in WebView2 for the map surface, recorded as a Jupiter exception. Finding: the stock style hides interstate/US/state route numbers at regional zooms although the tiles contain them; Offline Maps needs its own derived style.

Not covered: WebView2 itself, Rust-served tiles, a network-adapter-off launch and long-session memory.

## Stage 3: map style, Rust-served tiles and package record

Completed 8 November 2026.

- **Rust core.** `mbtiles` opens a package read-only, validates its metadata (pbf format, zoom range, bounds, declared vector layers), serves tiles by XYZ address with gzip passthrough, and checks SQLite integrity and tile presence across declared zooms. `package` streams SHA-256 with cancellation, checks Illinois coverage and the Shortbread layers the style needs, and produces a versioned JSON `PackageRecord` keeping source URL, ETag, Last-Modified (data-date proxy), download time, verification time, size, hash, attribution and per-zoom tile counts. Sixteen unit tests cover row flipping, encoding detection, out-of-range tiles, malformed metadata, non-packages, missing or extra zooms, coverage, layer and schema rejection, hashing and record round trips.
- **Real package.** `offline-maps-dev inspect` verified the 8 November Illinois package in 2.1 s: SHA-256 `17c12c95…227cb9` (matches the download), 362,586,112 bytes, 81,302 tiles, integrity ok.
- **Dev server.** `offline-maps-dev serve` (std only, loopback, same-origin CSP) replaces the Node proof server and serves tiles through the core, standing in for WebView2 request interception. Unbundled glyph ranges return an empty glyph set (counted), path traversal and out-of-range tiles are refused, absent tiles return 204.
- **Styles.** `tools/build-styles.mjs` derives `assets/styles/offline-maps-{light,dark}.json` from VersaTiles 7.0.1 (MIT notice in `assets/styles/NOTICE.md`): same-origin paths only (the build fails on any remaining URL scheme), Mercator, OSM/Geofabrik attribution, and route shields drawn by the page — interstates from zoom 10, US/Illinois routes on trunk/primary roads from zoom 12, secondary routes from zoom 13. These are the zooms at which `tools/scan_tiles.py` found refs in the package; no street_labels exist below zoom 10. Shield images are registered when the style loads; registering them only on demand left some shields as bare text.
- **Glyphs.** The package uses 269 distinct characters in 25 glyph ranges, two of which (emoji, enclosed alphanumerics) Noto Sans does not cover. `assets/glyph-ranges.json` bundles those 23 ranges plus a Latin/Greek/Cyrillic/punctuation baseline: 2 fonts × 23 ranges, 7.0 MB instead of 77 MB.

Verified in the desktop browser pane: interstate shields at zoom 10 (I-74, I-72), US 51, US 51 Business, IL 10 and IL 54 at zoom 12, Chicago at zoom 11 dark (I-90, I-94, I-55, I-290, I-294, US 41), Chinatown at zoom 16, plus a sweep of Springfield, Carbondale, Champaign, western Illinois, the Loop, Quincy and Rockford. 0 map errors, 0 CSP violations, 0 missing glyph ranges, 105 tiles served by Rust; the only 404 was the browser's favicon request. The pane was hidden for much of this, so frame timings were throttled and are not reported.

Not covered: WebView2 hosting, a network-adapter-off launch, a scan of the package during download verification (glyph coverage is currently checked by the separate Python scan), and keyboard/accessibility of the map surface.

## Stage 4: download, staged storage and activation

Completed 8 November 2026.

- **Transport.** `HttpTransport` uses ureq 3.5.1 with native-tls (SChannel) and the Windows certificate store; no CA bundle is shipped. Finite timeouts: 20 s resolve and connect, 60 s to first response, 60 s per read, so a stalled connection fails instead of hanging. Every request sends `Cache-Control: no-cache` (see the Geofabrik finding below). Resumes use `Range: bytes=N-` with `If-Range: <strong ETag>`, and 206 responses must carry a consistent `Content-Range`.
- **Store.** `PackageStore` keeps `<root>/<region>/active.json`, `versions/<v>/{package.mbtiles,record.json}` and `staging/{package.part,download.json,lock}`. A version is complete before `active.json` names it, and `active.json` is replaced through a flushed temporary file and a single rename, so a crash leaves the old or the new package active, never a partial one. An OS file lock prevents concurrent updates. Version names are validated so a corrupted pointer cannot address outside the store.
- **Update flow.** `update_region` probes the server; reports up to date when the ETag and size match the active package or the server's copy is older; enforces a size cap (2 GiB default) and free space (download plus 256 MiB); resumes the staging file only when the URL, strong ETag and total size all still match, otherwise restarts; streams with progress and cancellation; verifies with `verify_package`; refuses to activate a download older than the active package; installs, activates and prunes old versions (best effort, so a version still open in the renderer is removed later). Failed verification discards the download; cancellation and network failures keep it for resume; the active package is untouched in every failure path.
- **Tests.** 32 unit tests, including ten update-flow tests with a fake server: first download, up-to-date detection, resume after a dropped transfer, restart when the file changes, restart when the server ignores ranges, cancellation, invalid download, replacement and pruning, size/disk/lock refusals, and never replacing with older data. Two integration tests drive the real transport over loopback HTTP, including a dropped connection followed by a ranged resume.
- **End to end (local).** `offline-maps-dev download` against the dev server's `/source/package.mbtiles` route with the real 362.6 MB package: cancelled at 150 MB (staging kept, 150,003,712 bytes); the next run resumed at that offset, verified and activated in 5.1 s with SHA-256 `17c12c95…227cb9` matching the original download; a third run reported up to date with no GET.
- **Live Geofabrik checks.** TLS through SChannel works; 404 and an expired certificate fail with clear errors.
- **Live download (Geofabrik, 07:32–07:34 UTC).** `offline-maps-dev download data/store-live`: cancelled at 100 MB (staging 100,004,067 bytes with ETag `"159ca000-65fbc0e0a1d71"` and Last-Modified 8 Nov 04:12:34); the next run resumed at that offset via a 206 response, downloaded the remaining 262.6 MB and verified and activated the package in 43.8 s (about 6 MB/s); SHA-256 `17c12c95…227cb9` matches the curl download. A third run reported up to date in 0.5 s with no GET.

**Geofabrik caching finding.** Geofabrik's download proxy (`download-proxy11`, squid, `Cache-Control: max-age=604800`) answered plain HEAD requests from a 6.4-day-old cache entry reporting the 1 November build, and a differently-headed HEAD got a 6 November build, while a GET returned the 8 November build. With `Cache-Control: no-cache` every response reported the current build (8 November, 362,586,112 bytes, ETag `"159ca000-65fbc0e0a1d71"`), matching the package downloaded this morning. The transport therefore always sends `no-cache`, and the older-data guard protects against any proxy that still serves stale content.

Not covered: a live update where Geofabrik has published a newer build than the active one (the guard and replacement paths are covered by tests), the app's choice of store location (`%LOCALAPPDATA%` is the expected root, decided at integration), and a progress/cancel UI.

## Stage 5: offline search and saved places

Completed 8 November 2026.

- **Tile decoder.** `mvt` reads Mapbox Vector Tiles (gzip, layers, attributes) and one representative point per feature; no third-party MVT dependency. Coordinates are checked against independently computed tile bounds.
- **Search index.** `search::build_index` reads every zoom-14 tile and writes a separate SQLite FTS5 file (`search.sqlite`) beside the package: places, named streets (one entry per street name per nearest town, placed on the street), points of interest, stations/stops/airports and named water. Streets and points of interest carry their nearest town as context. Common abbreviations match both ways (street/st, avenue/ave, north/n, saint/st, interstate/i and others), route numbers are searchable (`us 51`, `i 55`), the last word matches as a prefix, and leading or trailing compass words do not block a strong match (`main street` finds West Main Street). Ranking: strong matches (exact name, name prefix, route number, category such as `hospital` or `police`) before other word matches before matches through the nearest town; cities, towns and villages first; then by distance from the map position when one is given, otherwise by place size and population. The index records the package SHA-256 and is rejected for any other package.
- **Package preparation.** `update_region` builds the index after verification and installs package, record and index together; a package is not activated without search. `search::open_or_build` builds a missing or mismatched index for packages installed earlier.
- **Saved places.** `places::SavedPlaces` keeps user places in `saved-places.json` at the store root, outside region and version directories, so package updates and pruning never touch it. Names (1–120 characters, no control characters) and notes (up to 2,000) are validated; changes are written atomically and adopted only after a successful write; ids are never reused; an unreadable file is reported and left untouched, and `move_aside_unreadable` preserves it under a new name before a fresh list is started. `is_covered_by` reports whether the active package's bounds include a place, so the app can say a place is outside the map rather than requesting remote data.
- **Tests.** 45 unit tests and 2 integration tests pass; Clippy and rustfmt are clean.

Real Illinois package (8 November build):

- Index: 482,723 entries (6,905 places, 340,520 streets, 98,825 points of interest, 24,419 transit, 12,054 water), 97.8 MB, built in 15–17 s (decoding all 60,649 zoom-14 tiles takes about 8 s).
- Full update from the local source route: verification 6.1 s, indexing, activation; 23.5 s in total. The live store installed before search had its index built in place in 15.4 s on first search.
- Queries take 1–40 ms. Examples: `springfield` → Springfield (state capital); `carbondale` → Carbondale, then its fire stations; `main st clinton` → West and East Main Street near Clinton; `us 51` → streets signed US 51; near Carbondale, `hospital` → Memorial Hospital of Carbondale (0.4 km) and `police` → Carbondale Public Safety Center (0.6 km); near Clinton, `pharmacy` → CVS 1.5 km; near the Loop, `oak st` → East and West Oak Street.

Limits of this package, found while testing:

- **No fuel stations.** Geofabrik's Shortbread tiles contain no `amenity=fuel` in points of interest, buildings or sites. For emergency use this is a real gap; the raw `.osm.pbf` contains them (added in stage 6).
- **No address search.** House numbers carry no street names in this schema (added from the raw extract in stage 7).
- **No county search.** Boundary labels at every zoom are state names only, and land areas are unnamed (named parks still appear as points of interest).
- **State line.** The extract includes border towns in neighbouring states without state attribution, so `clinton` without a position ranks Clinton, Iowa (a city) above Clinton, Illinois (a town). With the map position supplied, Clinton, Illinois comes first when viewing central Illinois. The app must always pass the map position.
- Recently renamed roads match their current OSM name only (`lake shore dr` finds bike-share docks before DuSable Lake Shore Drive).

## Stage 6: fuel and charging stations from the raw extract

Completed 8 November 2026.

- **PBF reader.** `osm_pbf` reads OpenStreetMap PBF files with no new dependency. It handles blob framing with the specification's size limits, zlib and uncompressed blobs, and the header (bounding box, required features, data timestamp). Files needing anything beyond `OsmSchema-V0.6` and `DenseNodes` are refused. It reads nodes, dense nodes, ways and relations with tags. Blocks are decompressed and decoded on up to 8 worker threads.
- **Extraction.** `extras::extract` reads `amenity=fuel` and `amenity=charging_station` mapped as points, areas or multipolygons.
  - Areas are placed at the mean of their nodes. This needs a second pass for node positions and, for multipolygons, a third.
  - `access=private` or `no` is excluded.
  - Each station keeps name (else brand, else operator), brand, operator, opening hours, notable fuels and address. The fuels listed are diesel, truck diesel, biodiesel, E85, LPG, CNG and DEF; octane grades are left out.
  - An area and a point inside it count as one station when they are within 150 m and their names or brands agree. The more complete copy is kept and filled from the other.
  - Cities, towns, villages, hamlets and suburbs are read for nearest-town context.
- **Extras store.** Stations live in a per-region extras database (`<root>/<region>/extras/versions/<v>/extras.sqlite`, with `record.json` and an atomic `active.json`), independent of the map package.
  - It holds the stations, towns and search entries in the package index's format. When the search format changes, entries are rebuilt from the stored stations without the raw file.
  - `update_extras` follows the package update rules: probe, `no-cache`, ETag-checked resume through the same staging code, size and space checks, older-data guard and lock.
  - It hashes the download, extracts, and checks that the extract's bounding box covers the region and that it has towns. It then installs, activates and prunes, and deletes the raw file.
  - The record keeps the source URL, ETag, Last-Modified, size, SHA-256, OSM data time and counts.
  - A failed or cancelled extras update never touches the map package or the previous extras.
- **Search.** `SearchIndex::attach_extras` adds the stations to every search.
  - `gas`, `gas station`, `petrol` and `fuel` find fuel stations; `ev`, `charger` and `charging station` find charging stations. Brands and names work as before.
  - Results carry a detail line (brand, hours, fuels, address).
  - The search format moved to version 2 (detail column), so earlier package indexes are rebuilt on first open.
  - Search results with the same name are now kept apart unless they are within a few hundred metres. Previously, two same-brand stations in one town were collapsed into one.
- **Map.** The styles add a GeoJSON source (`/extras/stations.geojson`) with fuel and charging layers. Fuel uses the sprite fuel pump in amber; charging uses a green bolt drawn by the page. Fuel shows from zoom 11, charging from zoom 12, names from zoom 14. Both are placed above street names and route shields, so they win label collisions. Without extras the source is an empty collection.
- **Tests.** 52 unit tests and 2 integration tests pass; Clippy and rustfmt are clean. New tests cover:
  - the PBF reader: all element types, the header, unsupported features, truncation and corruption;
  - extraction: point, area, multipolygon, private exclusion, duplicate merging and detail text;
  - search with extras, entry rebuild after a format change, and GeoJSON;
  - the update flow: install, up to date, and replacement with pruning. An extract without towns and a damaged file are both rejected, and the active extras are kept.

Real Illinois extract: `illinois-latest.osm.pbf`, which redirects to `illinois-261107.osm.pbf`. It is 363,155,297 bytes, with Last-Modified 8 Nov 2026 03:22:32, ETag `"15a54f61-65fbb5b2457e2"` and SHA-256 `1da2b14a…4680d`; its OSM data time is 7 Nov 2026 21:21:36 UTC.

- **Counts:** 3,415 fuel stations and 464 charging stations, with 393 duplicate copies merged and none unlocated; 3,697 towns. Three reading passes take 2.5 s, and the extras file is 1.9 MB.
- **Update run:** `download-extras` through the local dev server was cancelled at 150 MB, then resumed, verified, extracted and activated in 6.5 s. The next run reported up to date with no GET. The raw file was removed from staging.
- **Search examples:**
  - Near Springfield, `gas` → Marathon 0.8 km (hours, address), then Amoco 1.0 km (open 24/7).
  - Near Clinton, `gas station` → Mach1, Phillips 66, Circle K, Casey's (0.5–1.0 km).
  - Near the Loop, `ev charger` → ChargePoint 0.3 km, EVIUM, Tesla Supercharger (open 24/7, address).
- **Map, in the desktop browser pane:**
  - Clinton at zoom 15 shows Casey's, Circle K and Mach1 with names. Phillips 66, 40 m from Mach1, gives way.
  - The Loop at zoom 15.5, dark, shows BP and ChargePoint.
  - 42 fuel stations are drawn around Springfield at zoom 11.5.
  - 0 map errors, 0 CSP violations, and no missing requests apart from the browser's favicon.

Limits:

- Coverage is whatever OSM mappers have entered; for example, there are only four fuel stations near Carbondale.
- About 10% of fuel stations are unnamed and unbranded, and are shown as "Fuel station".
- Each extras update needs a raw extract download of about 363 MB, in addition to the 363 MB package. The app should therefore offer extras updates separately from map updates.

## Stage 7: address search from the raw extract

Completed 8 November 2026.

- **Extraction.** The same reading passes now collect addresses: `addr:housenumber` with `addr:street` (or `addr:place` for rural addresses) on points, buildings and multipolygons.
  - A building is placed midway between its first node and the node halfway round its outline. For a simple outline this lies inside the building, and it needs two node positions per building instead of all of them.
  - Node positions for the second pass are held in a sorted table, not a hash map.
  - Interpolation lines (`addr:interpolation`, 209 in Illinois) and numbers longer than 16 characters are not used.
- **Towns.** An address keeps its `addr:city`. Otherwise it is assigned to the settlement whose covered radius best contains it: distance divided by a radius from `population` (about 20 km for Chicago, 2 km for a town of 25,000) or from the kind of place.
  - With plain nearest-town assignment, Chicago addresses without a city tag were split among neighbourhood and suburb names, and only 90,700 were found under Chicago; with the weighting, 480,186 are.
  - Suburbs and quarters within 2 km are kept as extra searchable words, so `1601 n clark lincoln park` works.
  - This is a heuristic, not municipal boundaries. Near a town line an address can be credited to the neighbouring town.
- **Storage.** The extras database (format 2) adds one row per street and town, with an FTS5 index over street, town and suburb names, and one compact row per house number. Positions are stored in millionths of a degree; the primary key is street and normalized number, without rowid.
  - Repeated numbers on one street are kept once: a point is preferred over a building outline, then the southernmost.
  - Streets are sorted, so the same extract always produces the same address data (checked by hashing two runs).
  - Address tables are carried over when search entries are rebuilt after a search-format change.
  - `update_extras` replaces active extras in an older format or that cannot be opened, even when the source is unchanged.
- **Search.** A query starting with a house number (digits with at most one letter, so `1st street` and `22nd` are ordinary searches) is matched against streets, towns and suburbs, then the number is looked up on each matching street.
  - Numbers are compared without spaces, punctuation or case (`101-A` = `101a`).
  - Exact matches come first: strong street matches before weaker ones, then by distance from the map position.
  - When no street has the number, each matching street offers its nearest listed number, labelled `2100 is not listed; nearest listed number on this street`.
  - Address results come before other results; a query that is not address-shaped is unaffected.
- **Tests.** 55 unit tests and 2 integration tests pass; Clippy and rustfmt are clean. New tests cover:
  - addresses on points, buildings and multipolygons, and town, suburb and duplicate handling;
  - exact and nearest-number search, house-number forms, and queries that are not addresses;
  - address tables surviving a rebuild, and an outdated extras file being replaced by an update.

Real Illinois extract (same file as stage 6):

- **Counts:** 843,142 addresses on 32,049 street-and-town groups. 35,070 were dropped as repeats or with nodes missing from the extract.
- **Size and speed:** the extras file is 34.9 MB, about 29 MB of it house numbers. Extraction takes 8.7 s with a peak working set of 189 MB.
- **Update run:** `download-extras` through the local dev server replaced the format 1 extras from the same source in 16.1 s (full transfer over loopback, verification, extraction, activation). The next run reported up to date.
- **Search examples** (2–5 ms each):
  - `905 e main st carbondale` → 905 East Main Street, Carbondale.
  - `906 east main carbondale` → 905, labelled as the nearest listed number.
  - `1601 n clark chicago` and `1601 n clark lincoln park` → 1601 North Clark Street, Chicago.
  - From Springfield, `100 n main` → 100 North Main Street in Chatham (14.7 km) and Athens (18.9 km).
  - `2100 s 6th st springfield` → 2101 South 6th Street, labelled as nearest.
- **Map:** unchanged. Clinton at zoom 15 still shows its fuel stations, with 0 errors and 0 CSP violations.

Limits:

- Coverage is OSM's. Chicago and a number of counties have imported addresses; many rural areas have few or none.
- Towns without a city tag are inferred from settlement points, not boundaries.
- Interpolated address ranges are not searched.
- The nearest listed number can be far from the one asked for on sparsely mapped streets. Its label says so, but it is not an interpolated position.

## Stage 8: WinUI app, ABI and installer

Completed 8 November 2026. Version 0.1.0.

- **C ABI.** `crates/offline-maps-ffi` builds `offline_maps_ffi.dll` (ABI version 1).
  - Exports: `om_abi_version`, `om_create`, `om_call` (a protobuf `Request` in, a `Response` out, from `proto/offline_maps.proto`), `om_tile`, `om_progress`, `om_cancel`, `om_result_bytes`, `om_result_free` and `om_destroy`. `om_tile` is the one bulk export and returns raw decompressed vector tiles.
  - Expected failures arrive as typed errors in the response; statuses are reserved for transport problems.
  - Panics are caught and leave the core unusable for normal calls; `om_cancel`, `om_progress` and freeing still work.
  - The core is safe to call from several threads. Tile reads, search and saved places each take their own lock, and an update holds none of them, so the map stays usable while a new one downloads.
  - Progress is polled, not called back. Cancellation never waits behind the running update.
  - Built with the static C runtime and Control Flow Guard, and with `panic = "unwind"` in release.
- **Managed bindings.** `OfflineMaps.Interop` uses `LibraryImport` and `SafeHandle` with disabled runtime marshalling. The native library loads only from the app folder. The ABI version is checked before anything else, request IDs are checked, and every result is copied before it is freed.
- **App.** WinUI 3 on .NET 10 and Windows App SDK 2.5.1, unpackaged and self-contained, single instance. It is a canvas workspace (style standard section 7):
  - Menu bar: File, Edit, View, Map, Places, Help.
  - Info bars for no map, download progress, errors and the stations-and-addresses offer.
  - The map, and a resizable search pane with saved places.
  - A status bar with the map and extras dates, and the map position.
  - A Settings window with the shared Theme and Accent color controls, distance units and the map folder.
  - Downloads ask first and state the size and source. Progress is shown in the info bar and the status bar, the map stays in use, and Cancel keeps the partial file for resuming.
  - Search runs off the UI thread, debounced, near the map centre, with stale results discarded.
  - Saved places can be added from the map centre, a search result or the map's context menu, then edited and removed (removal asks first).
  - Closing during a download asks first, cancels, waits for the core, saves the view and settings, closes the web view and releases the core.
  - Window placement and the map view are restored.
- **Map page.** `web/` holds the page MapLibre runs in. The shell sends theme colors, units, saved places, selections, zoom and reload commands as messages; the page reports the view, context menu, clicked places and shortcuts. Requests are served by the shell's request handler (see [Jupiter conformance](jupiter-exceptions.md)).
  - Finding: a WebView2 virtual host folder mapping bypasses `WebResourceRequested`. With one in place, tile and GeoJSON requests from MapLibre's worker failed with status 0, so the handler now serves the whole `map.local` origin.
- **Installer.** `pwsh build/build.ps1` is the release command. It runs `cargo fmt`, Clippy, the Rust tests and the interop tests, publishes, checks the published files and that the native binaries are x64, and builds `dist/OfflineMaps-0.1.0-win-x64-setup.exe` (279 MB, most of it the bundled WebView2 runtime).
  - Per-user install to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Offline Maps`, with a top-level Start Menu entry and an uninstaller.
  - The offline WebView2 runtime installer is bundled, signature-checked at build time, and run only if the runtime is missing.
  - Third-party notices are generated by `tools/third-party-notices.py`.
- **Tests.** 55 core unit tests, 2 HTTP integration tests and 6 ABI tests (Rust), plus 9 managed/native boundary tests (C#). The boundary tests cover the ABI version, empty store, saved places with Unicode, typed creation errors, network errors, malformed and empty requests, unknown protobuf fields and concurrent calls. A real-store test runs with `OFFLINE_MAPS_TEST_STORE` (both sides pass against the Illinois store). The style check reports 0 violations.

Verified on Ian's machine (Windows 11, 200% scaling):

- **Development build** against the local Illinois store:
  - The map rendered from the core.
  - `905 e main st carbondale` → 905 East Main Street, shown with an accent marker beside Casey's (fuel layer).
  - A place was saved with Ctrl+D through the dialog: listed, selected and written to `saved-places.json`.
- **Installed app:**
  - Silent install; Start Menu shortcut and uninstall entry present.
  - Launched from the Start Menu shortcut: first-run state (no map, Download map).
  - With a scratch store and the dev server as source, Download map installed the 362.6 MB package and its search index through the app, with progress. The map appeared and the stations-and-addresses offer opened.
  - Download stations and addresses then installed the extras, and the map showed fuel stations.
  - Reinstalling over the installed copy (upgrade path, same AppId) and uninstalling left `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Jupiter\OfflineMaps` unchanged: settings and a partly downloaded Geofabrik package. Uninstalling removed the program, the shortcut and the uninstall entry. Reinstalling restored the shortcut, and the app launched from it.

Not covered:

- A launch with networking disabled.
- A full Geofabrik download through the installed app (one started from the installed app was stopped at 173 MB when the window was closed; it resumes from there).
- A clean machine without development tools.
- Screen reader, high contrast and text scaling review.
- The light theme of the app shell.
- Code signing.

Known limits:

- Closing takes a few seconds while WebView2 shuts down.
- Saved places are shown on the map but are not separately selectable when a search marker covers them.
- The app's own license is not yet chosen (About says so).

## 0.1.1: search results and ranking

Completed 8 November 2026. Reported by Ian on 0.1.0: search did not seem connected to the map, and suggestions only appeared once the whole name was typed.

- **Clicking a result did nothing.** The empty-list message shares the results list's grid cell and was drawn over it, taking every mouse click. Enter worked because it selects the first row in code, so search appeared to need the full name. The message no longer takes clicks.
- **Partial names ranked nearby villages first.** Near the map centre, settlements were ordered by distance alone, so `carb` near Evanston listed Carbon Hill and Carbon Cliff before Carbondale. Settlements now come by exact name, then size (city, town, village), then distance. Streets, points of interest and stations are still ordered by distance. New test: `spring` near Chicago puts Springfield before a nearer village; the village's full name puts it first.
- **Zoom on selection.** A selected result is shown at its own zoom (a city at 11, a village at 13, an address at 18). Before, the map never zoomed out, so a town picked while at street level stayed at street level.

Verified in the installed app (upgraded silently from 0.1.0; Start Menu entry, uninstall entry at 0.1.1, map store and settings kept): launched from the Start Menu, `carb` listed Carbondale first, and a mouse click on Carbon Hill selected it and moved the map there at zoom 13.

## 0.2.0: more regions

Completed 8 November 2026. Ian asked for other mapsets to be downloadable, to fill the map out to other states.

- **Catalog.** 52 regions from Geofabrik's index (see [sources](sources-and-architecture.md#regions-020)), with approximate download sizes. Alaska is left out (29.6 GB package spanning the antimeridian).
- **Core.** The service holds every installed region: tiles are read from each package that touches them and merged on borders, search ranks all regions' results together, stations come from all extras, and saved places count as covered inside any installed map. New commands: `GetCatalog`, `RemoveRegion`; `Update` names a region. The status lists installed regions and the box around them, and a content version that changes with any map or extras.
- **App.** Map > Regions… opens a Regions window (collection workspace): filter, list of regions with their state, and a pane with Download or Update map, Download or Update stations and addresses, and Remove (asks first; Cancel is the default). Downloads are queued and run one at a time in the map window's progress bar; Cancel stops the current one and clears the queue. Map > Update all regions… queues every installed map and extras. The no-map and stations messages and Map information cover several regions.
- **Tests.** Core: catalog consistency, tile merging (joined layers, renumbered tags, duplicates, bad tags), search across two indexes. ABI: catalog, removal of an absent and an unknown region, updates naming an unknown region. Interop: catalog and removal. 59 core, 2 HTTP and 6 ABI tests (Rust) and 9 interop tests (C#) pass; the real-store test passes against the Illinois store.

Verified in the installed app (upgraded silently from 0.1.1; Illinois map, extras and settings kept; launched from the Start Menu):

- Regions listed 52 regions; filtering "indi" left Indiana, "About 248 MB".
- Download map for Indiana showed progress in its row ("Map: Downloading: 58 MB of 248 MB"), then installed and prepared search in about 25 seconds. The status bar read "Completed: the Indiana map installed" and the stations offer named Indiana.
- Searching "hammond" listed Hammond, Indiana (city) before Hammond, Illinois (village). At zoom 10 and 14 the map was continuous across the state line at Calumet City and Hammond, with labels on both sides and no doubled labels.
- Remove Indiana asked first, deleted `us-in`, and the map and search went back to Illinois alone. A message bug found here ("Completed 0 downloads and updates" after a removal) was fixed before release.

Not covered: stations and addresses for a second region (a further 202 MB for Indiana), two downloads queued at once, and cancelling a queued download in the installed app.

## 0.3.0: terrain

Completed 8 November 2026. Ian asked whether other mapsets could add layers such as topography. Terrain comes from Mapterhorn (see [sources](sources-and-architecture.md#terrain-030)).

- **Measured first.** A script read only the archive's index to size each region at zoom 0–12 (Illinois: z12 3,901 tiles, 271 MB; z0–12 366 MB; 0.2 MB of index read). Zoom 12 was chosen: about 15 m per pixel, enough for shading and street-level contours; zoom 13 would quadruple the size. All 52 regions are in the catalog with their terrain size (`tools/make-regions.py`, 4th input).
- **Core.** `pmtiles.rs` reads a PMTiles v3 index through range requests (header, root and leaf directories, Hilbert tile IDs). `terrain.rs` downloads a region's tiles in joined ranges with `If-Range`, resumes after cancelling, detects a file replaced on the server mid-download, checks the tile count, and installs atomically. `Transport` gained `fetch_range` (an exact `Range` request; HTTP 200 to an `If-Range` request means the file changed).
- **ABI and app.** Update target `TERRAIN` (needs the region's map), `GetTerrainTile`, terrain state per region and the box around all terrain in the status. The Regions window has Download or Update terrain with its size; View > Terrain shading and View > Contour lines (kept in settings, on by default); Map information and the third-party notices carry the Copernicus notice.
- **Tests.** PMTiles: tile IDs against the specification's reference value, root and leaf directory lookup. Terrain (fake archive server): download and serving, up to date on a second run (3 requests: header, root, one joined range), replacement by a newer file and pruning of the old one, a file changed mid-download, cancel and resume, and Illinois's zoom-12 tile count matching Mapterhorn's index (3,901). ABI and interop: empty terrain tile, terrain refused without a map. 66 core, 2 HTTP and 6 ABI tests (Rust) and 9 interop tests (C#) pass.

Verified in the installed app (upgraded silently from 0.2.0; launched from the Start Menu):

- Regions showed Illinois terrain as about 366 MB; Download terrain showed progress in the row and installed in about 70 seconds: 5,309 tiles, 365.6 MB, with the archive's ETag recorded.
- A bug found here: the terrain layers were never added, because `map.isStyleLoaded()` is false inside MapLibre's `style.load` while tiles are still loading. The page now tracks style readiness itself. Fixed before release.
- At Galena (zoom 12 and 14) hillshading and contour lines followed the river valleys under the roads and labels, contour labels read "600 ft", "700 ft" and "750 ft", and street and town labels took precedence. The map credited "Terrain: Mapterhorn, USGS, Copernicus".
- View > Terrain shading turned the shading off and on, leaving the contours, and was kept in settings. The terrain credit now stays while only contours are shown (fixed after this check).

Not covered: terrain for a region other than Illinois, metric contours, the light theme with terrain, and an update of terrain when Mapterhorn publishes a new archive.

## 0.3.1: Show whole map

Completed 8 November 2026. Reported by Ian: View > Show whole map stopped short of the installed maps (with Illinois and Indiana: zoom 6.0, southern Illinois and the top of both states cut off). The view was only allowed half a degree beyond the maps, and MapLibre does not zoom out past that limit, so a tall box in a wide window could not fit. The limit now leaves the box's larger side free in every direction, and a first launch opens on the whole map. Verified in the installed app: zoom 5.7 with both states in view.

## 0.4.0: outdoor places

Completed 8 November 2026. The first of three layers Ian approved (outdoor places, flood zones, public lands).

- **Extraction.** The extras now also keep shelters (`amenity=shelter` except public-transport shelters, wilderness and alpine huts), drinking water (`amenity=drinking_water` and `water_point`, taps and springs marked drinkable; not water marked undrinkable), campgrounds (`tourism=camp_site` and `caravan_site`) and public toilets. Private places, and customers-only shelters and toilets, are left out. Extras record an extraction version; older extras are rebuilt on update even from an unchanged data file.
- **Map and search.** Four layers draw them from the stations source with icons drawn by the page (shelters from zoom 12, campgrounds 11, water 13, toilets 14; names from 15); View > Outdoor places turns them off. Search finds them by name or by words such as "campground", "water", "shelter", "restroom".
- **App.** Regions and Map information show the counts; regions whose extras predate outdoor places get an offer to update them.
- **Tests.** Classification rules (including bus shelters, undrinkable water and customers-only toilets) and extraction with names; 68 core tests pass.

Verified in the installed app (upgraded from 0.3.1): the offer named Illinois and Indiana; the update rebuilt both in about 70 seconds (Illinois 3,363 shelters, 951 drinking water, 516 campgrounds, 1,861 toilets; Indiana 1,635, 288, 407, 848). Searching "campground" and "shelter" listed nearby places with their towns; around Lincoln Park Zoo the map showed toilets, drinking water and shelters with labels at zoom 15. Found here and fixed before release: the offer's button said "Download" for regions that only needed an update. Park names are not searchable: Shortbread tiles carry no names for land areas.

## 0.5.0: flood zones and public lands

Completed 8 November 2026. Ian chose prebuilt overlay files published on GitHub over converting government files on each computer.

- **Sources checked.** FEMA's Map Service Center answered a search and served the Illinois state file to a plainly named client (no browser imitation). ScienceBase, the bulk PAD-US host, redirected file downloads to a sign-in page (its download page forces a Keycloak login, and its signed-link API refuses anonymous requests), so PAD-US comes from the public USGS feature service instead.
- **Build tool.** `tools/layers/build_overlays.py` and `overlays.yml`; see [sources](sources-and-architecture.md#flood-zones-and-public-lands-050). Illinois: 70 MB, 43,361 tiles.
- **Core and app.** `overlays.rs` downloads (resumably, through the shared staging download), checks the layers and region, records the sources stamped in the file and installs; the service serves and merges overlay tiles; the Regions window has Download or Update flood zones and public lands; View > Flood zones and View > Public lands; Map information has a colour key and the sources. `OFFLINE_MAPS_OVERLAYS_URL` points the app at another server for testing.
- **Tests.** Overlay install, up-to-date check, replacement and pruning, and refusal of a file without the overlay layers; empty overlay tile through the ABI. 69 core, 2 HTTP and 6 ABI tests (Rust) and 9 interop tests (C#) pass.

Verified in the installed app, downloading from a local server holding the Illinois file: Regions showed the download's progress and then "Flood zones and public lands: 70 MB; flood data effective 07/21/2026, USGS PAD-US 4.1". At Havana the Illinois River floodplain was shaded as flood zones, Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge and the Illinois River Floodplain Complex showed as public land with labels, and the map credited FEMA and USGS. Fixed after this check (the build data confirms the labels; the map was not looked at again because Ian was using the computer): labels without PAD-US's "Fee" suffix and none for easements, lighter flood shading, a shorter credit, wrapping command names in the Regions pane, and a terrain decoding message that filled the log where no region's terrain covers a tile.

Not yet done: the `overlays` release on GitHub, which the app's default address points to (`https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps/releases/download/overlays/<region>-overlays.mbtiles`). Until it exists, the download fails with a network error.

## 0.5.1: overlay files for every region

Completed 9 November 2026. Ian asked for all regions to be built.

- **Build.** `build_overlays.py --all` built all 52 regions in about 4.8 hours of build time, 4.78 GB together: from 0.8 MB (US Virgin Islands) to 322 MB (Iowa, 839,273 flood areas); Florida and Texas 259 MB each. 4,975,627 flood areas and 459,346 public land areas in all. FEMA downloads and intermediate files were deleted after each region; the files and `summary.json` are in `data/layer-build/out` (not in git).
- **No FEMA state file.** FEMA's search listed none for Alabama, Idaho, Louisiana, Washington and the US Virgin Islands; these were read from FEMA's NFHL map service (see [sources](sources-and-architecture.md#flood-zones-and-public-lands-050)). Fetching each cell's shapes failed with HTTP 500, as did single very large areas, so the build lists IDs per cell and reads areas by ID with coordinates to six decimals, simplifying an area to 0.5 m only if it still fails (one in Alabama).
- **Older flood data.** Most state files are effective 2024–2026; Connecticut is 2023, Delaware 2020, Vermont 2015, DC 2010 and Puerto Rico 2009, as FEMA publishes them.
- **Catalog.** Regions carry the overlay file's size (`overlay_bytes`, from `summary.json` through `make-regions.py`); the Regions window shows it, and says "not available for this region yet" with the button disabled when it is 0.
- **Build environment.** The user `DOTNET_ROOT` points to `D:\lang\dotnet\sdk`, which lacks the pinned SDK 10.0.114; the installer was built with `DOTNET_ROOT` cleared for that process so the SDK in `C:\Program Files\dotnet` was used.

Verified: 69 core, 2 HTTP and 6 ABI tests (Rust) and 9 interop tests (C#) pass; the 0.5.1 installer installed over 0.5.0, the uninstaller entry reads 0.5.1, and the app started from the Start Menu entry. Read through UI Automation, the Regions window showed "About 51 MB" for Indiana, 166 MB for Louisiana and 1 MB for the US Virgin Islands, with the download button enabled.

## 0.6.0: Offline US Maps, public domain

Completed 9 November 2026, for publication on GitHub as Ian decided on 8 November ([project brief](project-brief.md#publication-decided-8-november-2026)).

- **Name.** Offline US Maps in windows, dialogs, the installer, Start and Settings > Apps. The installer keeps the AppId, so it upgrades the earlier install in place (same folder, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Offline Maps`), and removes the old "Offline Maps" Start and desktop shortcuts. The data folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Jupiter\OfflineMaps`), the AppUserModelID and the mutex are unchanged. The setup file is now `OfflineUSMaps-<version>-win-x64-setup.exe`.
- **Licence.** The Unlicense in `LICENSE`, installed as `LICENSE.txt`; About and the third-party notices say so, and the notices now name FEMA and USGS as the overlay sources. Cargo crates declare `Unlicense`. Jupiter.UI is released under the same licence (commit ea649e7 there).
- **Readme.** Rewritten for people installing from GitHub: install, features, data terms, and cloning Jupiter.UI beside the repository to build.

Verified: build script (fmt, clippy, 69 core, 2 HTTP and 6 ABI tests, 9 interop tests); 0.6.0 installed over 0.5.1; Settings > Apps lists Offline US Maps 0.6.0 under the same AppId; Start has "Offline US Maps" and no longer "Offline Maps"; installed maps (Illinois, Indiana) were kept; the app started from the new Start entry with the window titled Offline US Maps.

Published 9 November 2026: repositories [ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps) and [ianrastall/jupiter-ui](https://github.com/ianrastall/jupiter-ui) (public). Jupiter.UI's `Detach` methods on the theme and accent services, which this app has used since 0.1.0 but which were never committed there, were committed (60a62d4) so the published library builds the app. A clean clone of both repositories, side by side, built the app with no warnings and passed the interop tests. Releases: [v0.6.0](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps/releases/tag/v0.6.0) with the installer (not code-signed) and `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and [overlays](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps/releases/tag/overlays) with all 52 overlay files, whose GitHub SHA-256 digests match the build manifests. The installed release build downloaded Indiana's flood zones and public lands from GitHub in Map > Regions (51 MB, flood data effective 07/07/2026).

## 0.7.0: whole-country overview and update checks

Completed 9 November 2026. Ian asked for a map of the whole country, filled in by the downloaded regions, and said Update gave no sign of whether new maps were needed and downloaded everything again.

- **Why Update downloaded again.** The check was already there: an update compares the server's ETag, size and Last-Modified with the installed file and downloads nothing when they match. But Geofabrik rebuilds both the Shortbread package and the raw extract daily (on 9 November the Illinois package was dated 04:10 GMT that day), so nearly every update found a newer file, and the app gave no way to see that before downloading.
- **Check without downloading.** `Update` takes `check_only`: each update function returns `Available` (with the newer file's date and size) where it would have downloaded. Map > Check for updates replaces Update all regions: it checks every installed part, then either says everything is up to date or lists the newer parts with their dates, the installed dates and sizes, and offers to download them. In Map > Regions, Check for updates does the same for one region; each part's line then says whether it is the newest version, and an installed part has a download button only when a newer version was found.
- **Overview.** `tools/overview/build_overview.py` builds `assets/overview/us-overview.mbtiles` (3.7 MB, zoom 0–7, committed) from Natural Earth 1:10m, public domain: ocean and lakes, rivers, borders between states and with Canada and Mexico, Interstates and US and state highways, cities and capitals, state names. Features in a state or territory carry its region ID (borders carry both neighbours'). The core serves the file at `overview/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf`. The page draws it under everything; below zoom 6 it is the whole map (the base packages are not drawn there: their low-zoom tiles carry names for the whole country, which doubled the overview's); from zoom 6 its features inside installed regions are left out. State and country names come only from the overview. With no region installed, the map opens on the 48 contiguous states, and the view can move over the whole country.

Verified: Rust tests (70 core including a check-only test, 2 HTTP, 6 ABI including an empty overview tile) and the app build with no warnings. In the development build with Illinois and Indiana installed: the whole country at zoom 3.7 with one set of names; Michigan's border with Indiana not drawn twice; at zoom 11 on the Chicago lakefront, no overview water over land; with an empty profile, the overview of the 48 states with the No map is installed bar. Check for updates found the Illinois map (downloaded that morning) and both regions' terrain current, and listed both regions' stations and addresses (Geofabrik's file of 9 November) and Illinois's flood zones (installed from a local test copy, so the GitHub file counts as different), 635 MB together; Not now downloaded nothing.

Released 9 November 2026 as [v0.7.0](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps/releases/tag/v0.7.0), built from 7d11e5b; the installer's SHA-256 (25e77b62…dbb6b) matches GitHub's digest. 0.7.0 installed over 0.6.0 here: Settings > Apps lists Offline US Maps 0.7.0 under the same AppId, `Overview\us-overview.mbtiles` is in the program folder, and the app started from the Start entry with the overview around Illinois and Indiana.

Known at release: some place labels near the Chicago lakefront at zoom 11 lost letters ("Maple Park" drawn as "Ma le Par k"); the installed 0.6.0 showed the same. Fixed in 0.7.1.

## 0.7.1: labels no longer crossed by roads

Completed 9 November 2026. The labels with missing letters were public-land names (green, from the flood zones and public lands download). The page inserted them, like the contour labels, below `water-river`, so roads, railways and paths were drawn over them and cut through letters. Both are now inserted just below the base style's first label layer (`label-address-housenumber`): over every road and line, under the base map's own labels. The overview's names and city dots moved there too, so terrain shading and overlay fills no longer dim them.

Verified: at zoom 12 over Evanston, "Lighthouse Landing", "Leahy Park", "Maple Park", "Philbrick Park" and "Lunt Park" draw whole where 0.7.0 cut them, in the development build and in the installed 0.7.1 started from Start. Released as [v0.7.1](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps/releases/tag/v0.7.1), built from 8748bff; the installer's SHA-256 (06906734…e6d0581) matches GitHub's digest, and Settings > Apps lists 0.7.1.

## 0.16.0: Labels and search in other scripts

Completed 14 November 2026: stage W4 of the [worldwide plan](worldwide.md), started by Ian.

- **Fonts.** All 256 glyph ranges of Noto Sans regular and bold are bundled (77.3 MB, from the VersaTiles font package already pinned), Ian's choice over downloading a script's fonts with its first region. The installer is 308.5 MB (was 291.6 MB).
- **Right-to-left text.** mapbox-gl-rtl-text 0.3.0 (npm, pinned in `proof/renderer`'s lockfile; BSD-2-Clause, with code derived from ICU under the Unicode license) is bundled in `Web/rtl/` and given to MapLibre with `setRTLTextPlugin`, loaded when a label needs it. 1.0.0 was not usable: it is an ES module with a separate WASM file for Mapbox GL's newer loader. Both notices are in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`, which now also credits Noto's authors for every script and Adobe for Noto Sans CJK, and calls the overview the world's.
- **CJK search.** The tokenizer treats a run of Chinese, Japanese or Korean letters as one word, so only a name's beginning was found. Names are now indexed as overlapping pairs of letters as well as whole, a query is split the same way, and one CJK letter searches as a prefix.
- **English names.** Entries keep OpenStreetMap's English name (new `alt_name` and `match_alt` columns): a city searched in English ranks first ("jerusalem" found hotels named Jerusalem before), and a name without Latin letters is shown with it: "ירושלים (Jerusalem)".
- **Region note.** Now on 15 regions only, in countries written in scripts MapLibre draws with broken letter shapes (India's zones, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Maldives), saying so. Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Georgian, Armenian and Ethiopic regions no longer carry it.
- **Search format 4**: installed indexes are rebuilt at the next start.
- **Corrections.** The 0.12.0 notes and a page comment called the bundled MapLibre 5; it is 6.16.0.
- **Tests.** 83 core (new: CJK pairs and queries), 2 HTTP, 7 ABI (Georgia without the note, Thailand with it) and 9 interop tests.

Checked with real data in a separate store (`offline-maps-dev download --region`, then the built app started with `--store` and `--settings` in scratch folders, Ian's data untouched):
- Search: "尖沙咀" finds Tsim Sha Tsui, and "沙咀" (its end) Sha Tsui Road; "山市" finds 松山市 (Matsuyama) and 福山市 (Fukuyama); "ירושלים", "بيروت" and "Երևան" find their capitals; "jerusalem", "tel aviv", "beirut", "yerevan", "takamatsu" and "matsuyama" put the city first, shown as "ירושלים (Jerusalem)", "高松市 (Takamatsu)" and so on.
- Labels: in Beirut, streets named only in Arabic ("شارع 62", "شارع 21") are drawn with their letters joined and in order; in Takamatsu, 大学通り (drawn vertically along the street), 丸亀町商店街 and 祇園通り. Jerusalem's Old City and central Yerevan show English names, which OpenStreetMap has for nearly every feature there.

## 0.15.0: Search for Latin-script Europe

Completed 14 November 2026: stage W3 of the [worldwide plan](worldwide.md), chosen by Ian.

- **Letters the tokenizer keeps.** SQLite's `unicode61` tokenizer with `remove_diacritics 2` folds most accents (Ștefan, Hà Nội) but not ł, ß, æ, ø, œ, þ, ð or đ (checked with SQLite 3.49: "lodz" did not find Łódź, "strasse" not Straße). The core folds them itself (ł l, ß ss, æ ae, ø o, œ oe, þ th, ð and đ d, and ș, ț, ħ, ŧ).
- **Spellings people type.** The index also holds German ä, ö, ü as ae, oe, ue and Danish and Norwegian ø and å as oe and aa ("muenchen", "koebenhavn", "aalesund"), and the result ranking compares a query with that spelling too, so "nuernberg" puts the city first rather than points named "nuernberg.de".
- **Streets.** German and Dutch compounds match written short or in full ("konigstr" finds Königstraße, "kerkstraat" Kerkstr.); separate street words and their abbreviations for German, Dutch, Polish, Czech, Italian and Portuguese (Straße/Str., Platz/Pl., ulica/ul., náměstí/nám., piazza/p.za, viale/v.le, praça/pça); a leading "ul." or "ulica" is dropped, since OpenStreetMap names Polish streets without it.
- **House numbers after the street**, as most of Europe writes them ("Königstraße 3"): found when the number is listed, and shown in that order. An unlisted number after a name is not taken for an address, so "route 66" still finds the route; the nearest-listed-number offer stays with a number before the street.
- **Category words** (fuel, charging, shelters, drinking water, campgrounds, toilets, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, police, fire stations) in German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Romanian, Hungarian and Turkish besides English, Spanish and French.
- **Region names.** Geofabrik writes 21 names on two lines ("Vestlandet<br />(Western Norway)"), which 0.13.0 and 0.14.0 showed with the tag; they are now one line ("Vestlandet (Western Norway)").
- **Search format 3.** Installed regions' search indexes are rebuilt at the next start (stations and addresses from their stored data; nothing is downloaded).
- **Fault from 0.13.0.** A database built in the temporary folder was named by process, time and file name, which two databases built at the same moment could share ("table meta already exists"; caught by the tests, which build in parallel, and likely in the app when several regions' stations and addresses are rebuilt after a format change). Each name now carries a serial number too.
- **Tests.** 82 core (new: unique temporary names; folding of the letters the tokenizer keeps, the spellings indexed, category words in the new languages, the Polish prefix; house numbers after the street), 2 HTTP, 7 ABI and 9 interop tests.

Checked with real data, downloaded through the core into a separate store with `offline-maps-dev download --region` and searched with `offline-maps-dev search --region` (new):
- Mittelfranken, near Nürnberg: "nuernberg" and "nurnberg" find Nürnberg first; "fuerth" Fürth; "konigstr" Königstraße; "koenigstrasse 3" Königstraße 3 in Nürnberg, Fürth and Schwabach; "tankstelle" fuel stations; "apotheke" pharmacies.
- Łódź Voivodeship: "lodz" finds Łódź; "piotrkowska 100" and "ul. Piotrkowska 100" the address; "ul piotrkowska" the street (before the prefix was dropped, fire hydrants named "ul. Piotrkowska 24"); "apteka" pharmacies; "stacja paliw" fuel stations.
- Denmark, near Copenhagen: "kobenhavn" and "koebenhavn" find København; "norrebrogade 10" Nørrebrogade 10; "aarhus" Aarhus first at 156 km; "apotek" pharmacies.

Installed over 0.14.0 on Ian's machine and started from Start: the 11 installed regions' search indexes were rebuilt for format 3 without a prompt (Illinois first, Wisconsin last), reaching "Search is ready" after 289 seconds on the USB drive G:, with no error.

Released 14 November 2026 as [v0.15.0](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-maps/releases/tag/v0.15.0), built from bd5d200; the installer's SHA-256 (033c7f8b…87a2b3a7) matches GitHub's digest.

## 0.14.0: Regions built for the rest of the world

Completed 14 November 2026: the second part of stage W2 of the [worldwide plan](worldwide.md).

- **154 regions built.** `tools/world-regions.py` now also lists the regions to build: Geofabrik regions with no package (140 after leaving out groupings: `dach`, `alps`, `britain-and-ireland`, `great-britain`, `sea`, regions mostly covered by smaller ones; a region with an enclave, such as Guangdong with Hong Kong and Macau, is not a grouping; South Africa is left out since South Africa and Lesotho, offered since 0.13.0, holds it) and the six crossing the 180th meridian, split there into a part west of 180° and one east of it (Fiji, Kiribati, New Zealand, American Oceania, Russia's Far Eastern Federal District; Tuvalu west only, its eastern part being open sea). Antarctica is left out. `tools/regions-build/build_shortbread.py --world` built them as Canada's were, from 10.8 GB of Geofabrik extracts of 13–14 November: 12.1 GB of maps, the largest Russia's Far East west of 180° (1.3 GB). They are in the `regions` release (233 files); every upload's SHA-256 matches GitHub's digest. 540 regions in all, in 193 countries and territories; 80 carry the script note.
- **IDs** are assigned once, in `tools/world-regions.py`, offered regions first, so the 286 IDs of 0.13.0 are unchanged (checked: every earlier catalog entry is identical). Parts add `-w` or `-e` (`fj-w`, `fj-e`).
- **Package checks for small regions.** Downloading a sample through the core (`offline-maps-dev download --region <id>`, new) refused Macau ("no tiles at declared zoom level 0": Planetiler leaves out zooms where a region has no features) and Rutland ("vector layer boundaries is missing": no national or state border runs through it). A package now needs tiles from some zoom up to its maximum without gaps, rather than at every declared zoom, and must declare at least one of Shortbread's layers rather than all six (another schema, such as OpenMapTiles, is still refused). Then all 154 built maps downloaded, verified, activated and had their search index built through the core.
- **Build fixes.** Region names such as Jihočeský stopped the first batch (Windows' code page for redirected output); the script writes UTF-8. Drive D: filled during the second batch (2 GB free; the extracts and maps had taken 11 GB); the script now deletes each extract after its last build, and the built maps were removed locally once uploaded and checked.
- **Overview.** 540 outlines, 15.6 MB.
- **Tests.** 77 core (new: a package starting above its minimum zoom is accepted, a gap is not; a reef's layers are accepted, OpenMapTiles' are not), 2 HTTP, 7 ABI and 9 interop tests.

Verified with the installed 0.14.0 on Ian's machine (upgraded over 0.13.0 and started from Start; the map folder and Ian's 11 regions kept, no error). Map > Regions: "11 of 540 regions installed"; continents North America, Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania, Central America, Europe, South America; Anhui (built) shows the script note, its sizes (map 84 MB, extract 44 MB, terrain 440 MB) and the `regions` release as its map's source. On the map, with the page's map object exposed for the test only, pointing at places highlighted the right region: Costa Rica `cr`, Berlin `de-berlin` and Potsdam `de-brandenburg` (the smaller region where outlines overlap), Hefei `cn-anhui`, Guangzhou `cn-guangdong`, Hong Kong `cn-hong-kong`, Suva `fj-w`, Lakeba in the Lau Islands `fj-e`, the Chatham Islands `nz-e`, Andorra `ad`, Rutland `gb-rutland`; Indianapolis, in installed Indiana, none. Clicking Costa Rica offered "Download the Costa Rica map (50 MB)" and "Show Costa Rica in Regions…" beside the pointer; Show opened Costa Rica in the Regions window. Nothing was downloaded; the shipped page and Ian's settings were put back.

Released 14 November 2026 as [v0.14.0](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-maps/releases/tag/v0.14.0), built from 5d5bb07; the installer's SHA-256 (4bc6c8e1…e25809cd) matches GitHub's digest.

## 0.13.0: Regions worldwide, and indexes built off the map drive

Completed 14 November 2026: the first part of stage W2 of the [worldwide plan](worldwide.md).

- **286 more regions.** Every region with no subregions in Geofabrik's index that has a Shortbread package, outside the US, Canada and Mexico (Greenland included), and whose outline does not cross the 180th meridian: 386 regions in all, in 173 countries and territories. `tools/world-regions.py` chose them (HEAD requests for every package and raw extract on 14 November; a 64 KB range request for each extract's header box); `offline-maps-dev terrain-size` sized their terrain (288.5 GB in all; Russia's Siberian Federal District alone is 37.9 GB). Left out for now: the seven that cross the meridian (Fiji 4.8 GB, Kiribati, New Zealand, Tuvalu, American Oceania, Antarctica, Russia's Far East 58.4 GB) and the 177 Geofabrik regions without a package.
- **Country, continent and a note.** The catalog gives each region its country and continent (Geofabrik's top-level areas; Russia's districts under Europe). 48 regions in countries written in scripts the map cannot draw yet (Arabic, Hebrew, Georgian, Armenian, Indic, Thai and other Southeast Asian scripts, Chinese, Japanese, Korean) carry a note shown first in Map > Regions: their streets are unlabeled for now, while towns and countries show English names where OpenStreetMap has them (the style already prefers `name_en`). Ian chose to offer them now rather than hold them back.
- **IDs.** A region's single ISO 3166-2 or 3166-1 code from Geofabrik's index (`ge`), else its country's code and Geofabrik's ID (`in-central-zone`, `de-berlin`), else Geofabrik's ID (`gcc-states`, `kaliningrad`); a code already taken falls back to the next form. Georgia the country (`ge`) and Georgia the state (`us-ga`) are both `georgia` at Geofabrik, which first overwrote the state's sizes in the generator; world regions are now keyed apart, and the 100 North American entries are unchanged apart from their country and continent.
- **Exact matching in the map.** The overview's features now carry the IDs of every region they lie in, separated by spaces, and the map matches installed regions as whole words or as a prefix with a dash (`mx` covers `mx-que`). Substring matching would have let India's zones match Indiana and California's ID contain Canada's.
- **Overview.** Geofabrik's outlines for the new regions (simplified to about 1 km) overlap in places (Berlin inside Brandenburg's, the Azores inside Portugal's), so they are cut into pieces tagged with every region that holds them; rivers, roads, lakes and places outside North America are tagged by them (Berlin "de-berlin de-brandenburg", Delhi "in-northern-zone", Indianapolis still "us-in"). Under the pointer the smallest region is chosen. 15.0 MB.
- **Regions window.** A Continent list beside the filter, groups by country (North America first, then the other continents and their countries alphabetically), the filter matching names, countries and continents, and the region's note first in its details. Terrain sources are described as national elevation models and Copernicus GLO-30, with Mapterhorn's attribution page.
- **Terrain cap.** One region's terrain may now be 40 GiB (was 16 GiB), for Greenland (18.7 GB) and Siberia (37.9 GB); the free-space check before each download is unchanged.
- **Indexes built off the map drive.** Ian's New York map downloaded completely to `G:\Maps`, then its search index stalled: after 50 minutes the file had 158 MB of 210 MB, and a debugger showed the update thread inside `WriteFile`. G: is a Seagate Backup Plus Slim (USB hard drive, exFAT): sequential writes run at about 45 MB/s, but SQLite's scattered page writes crawl (the same index written there by `offline-maps-dev index` reached 32.5 MB in 5 minutes; 42 seconds on C:). Search indexes and stations-and-addresses databases are now built in the system's temporary folder when it has 4 GiB free (else beside the map, as before), with a 128 MiB page cache, then copied to the map folder in one sequential write: New York's index onto G: in 39.4 seconds.
- **Tests.** 77 core (the catalog check now covers every region's country, continent and ID form), 2 HTTP and 7 ABI tests (new: Georgia the country and the state apart, with the note) and 9 interop tests (every region has a country and continent; 100 North American regions besides Greenland).

Verified with the installed 0.13.0 on Ian's machine, upgraded over 0.12.0 and started from Start: the status bar listed 11 installed regions (New York's map, whose index had stalled under 0.12.0, finished and was activated), with no error. Map > Regions showed "11 of 386 regions installed", the continents North America, Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania, Europe and South America, Asia grouped by country with sizes (Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh…), and Afghanistan's details opened with the script note, then its map (363 MB), stations and addresses (113 MB), "US regions only" for flood zones and terrain (2,573 MB). Hovering and clicking the new regions on the map was not checked in this build.

Released 14 November 2026 as [v0.13.0](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-maps/releases/tag/v0.13.0), built from 22d4448; the installer's SHA-256 (0e5f4e68…39624e4b) matches GitHub's digest.

## 0.12.0: Offline Maps, with a world overview

Completed 14 November 2026: stage W1 of the [worldwide plan](worldwide.md), started by Ian the same day.

- **World overview.** `tools/overview/build_overview.py` now covers the whole world (`assets/overview/world-overview.mbtiles`, 13.5 MB; the North American one was 4.2 MB): country borders, Natural Earth's state and province lines outside the catalog countries, major and secondary highways (expressways drawn as motorways), cities, country names from Natural Earth's label points and zooms, ocean, lakes and rivers with the Europe supplements. Inside the catalog countries nothing changed. The installer deletes the old `Overview\us-overview.mbtiles`.
- **Regions to fill in.** A new `regions` layer holds each catalog region's outline and name. Over a region with no map installed the pointer becomes a hand and the region is drawn in the accent color. A click, once it is clear it is not half of a double-click or a drag, shows a menu beside the pointer, never under it: "Download the <region> map (<size>)" and "Show <region> in Regions…", which opens the Regions window on that region.
- **Map bounds.** With the overview the map has no bounds. MapLibre 6 throws ("Cannot read properties of null") while placing the view when bounds span all 360 degrees of longitude; found in the first installed build, where the map stayed blank.
- **Name.** Offline Maps (Ian's choice, the app's first name) in windows, dialogs, the installer, Start, Settings > Apps, styles, notices and the setup file (`OfflineMaps-<version>-win-x64-setup.exe`). The repository is `ianrastall/offline-maps`; GitHub redirects the old addresses (checked: an overlay file under `offline-north-american-maps` answers 301 to `offline-maps`), so earlier versions keep downloading. The installer keeps the AppId, install folder, data folder, mutex and Start identity, and deletes "Offline North American Maps" shortcuts.
- **Not done.** The Regions window's continent level, moved to W2 (all regions are still in North America).
- **Tests.** 77 core, 2 HTTP and 7 ABI tests (Rust) and 9 interop tests; the app builds with no warnings.

Verified with the installed 0.12.0 on Ian's machine, upgraded over 0.11.0: Start lists only "Offline Maps", Settings > Apps lists Offline Maps 0.12.0, the program folder has only `world-overview.mbtiles`, and the map folder setting (`G:\Maps`) was kept. Through WebView2's DevTools port on loopback (as the acceptance script uses it): zoomed out, the map draws Iceland, Senegal, Cuba, Central America and Venezuela; panned to the Balkans, every country's borders, names and capitals. Over central New York (not installed) the pointer hand and the accent outline appear, and near Keene the highlight is New Hampshire. A single click shows the two menu items above the pointer, not covering it; Show opened the Regions window with New York in the detail pane. A double-click zoomed in with no menu.

Released 14 November 2026 as [v0.12.0](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-maps/releases/tag/v0.12.0), built from 8532c7e; the installer's SHA-256 (636a00b0…ef76d9ff) matches GitHub's digest. That build installed over the test builds, and started from Start it listed all 10 regions with no error.

During testing Ian was using the same running app. He downloaded New York's map and its flood zones and public lands while scripted clicks were being sent; the map download was taken for one the script had started and was cancelled twice, then stopped by a reinstall. The flood zones and public lands were installed; the map is kept at 693 of 846 MB to resume. Scripted checks now wait until the app is not in use.

## 0.11.0: Choosing and moving the map folder

Completed 14 November 2026, at Ian's request: maps had to live on G:, and Settings could not change the map folder.

- **Setting.** Settings > Map folder has a Change button (a folder picker). The chosen folder is kept in `settings.json` (`MapFolder`; absent or null means `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Jupiter\OfflineMaps\Maps`). With `--store`, the button is disabled and the caption says why.
- **Move or use as is.** After choosing, a dialog offers Move maps, Use without moving, or Cancel. Moving needs no restart: the core closes its packages and moves only its own entries (catalog region folders and saved-places files; other files in either folder stay). On one drive they are renamed; across drives they are copied into `<new>\.offline-maps-moving`, each file flushed to disk, then renamed into place, after a free-space check. The shell records the new folder, the core then removes the originals (only those now present in the new folder) and the old folder if it is empty, and the shell reopens the core on the new folder and reloads the map. Progress shows in the update bar ("Copied X MB of Y MB") with Cancel; cancelling, a failure, or closing the window during the copy removes the partial copy and reopens the original folder. Saved-place changes and downloads are refused while a move runs.
- **Refused destinations.** The same folder, a folder inside the current one or around it, and a folder that already holds a region folder or saved places of the same name (the message names them and suggests Use without moving).
- **Protocol.** `MoveStore` and `RemoveMovedSource` requests, `MoveStoreResult`, progress phase `Moving`. The ABI is unchanged.
- **Tests.** 77 core (6 new in `relocate.rs`: copying only the store's entries, renaming on one volume, conflicts and nested folders, an empty source, cancelling a copy, never removing an original missing from the destination), 2 HTTP and 7 ABI tests (new: a move through the C ABI that keeps saved places, refuses changes afterwards and reopens on the new folder) and 9 interop tests.

Verified on Ian's machine with the installed 0.11.0 (installed silently over 0.10.0; Settings > Apps lists 0.11.0, the Start entry launches the installed exe). Through Settings > Map folder > Change… and Move maps, the 10 installed regions (Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin, Ontario, Quebec) and saved places moved from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Jupiter\OfflineMaps\Maps` on C: (about 3.5 GB free) to `G:\Maps`: 10,595 MB copied in about 2 minutes, the originals and the empty `Maps` folder removed, `MapFolder` set to `G:\Maps`. The status bar then read "Moved the maps to G:\Maps" with no error. Closed and restarted from Start, the app listed all 10 regions with stations and addresses and showed no error or "No map is installed" bar. The dialog was driven through UI Automation. The script stopped with an error at the picker's folder box, yet the move to `G:\Maps` started; whether the picker took the script's value or was completed by hand is not known, and the confirmation dialog's text was not captured.

Released 14 November 2026 as [v0.11.0](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps/releases/tag/v0.11.0), built from 52cf053; the installer's SHA-256 (36759266…2dd62e8f) matches GitHub's digest. That build installed silently over the first 0.11.0 build, kept `MapFolder` (`G:\Maps`), and, started from Start, listed all 10 regions with no error.

Not covered: cancelling a real cross-drive move, a destination drive that runs out of space part-way, a removable drive missing at startup (the app then reports that the map folder could not be opened, and Settings can choose another).

## 0.10.0: Offline North American Maps

Completed 11 November 2026: stage 4 of the [North America and Android plan](north-america-and-android.md), with the name Ian chose.

- **Name.** Offline North American Maps in windows, dialogs, the installer, Start, Settings > Apps and the setup file (`OfflineNorthAmericanMaps-<version>-win-x64-setup.exe`). The installer keeps the AppId, install folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Offline Maps`), data folder, mutex and Start identity (`Jupiter.OfflineMaps`), and deletes "Offline US Maps" shortcuts left by earlier versions.
- **Repository.** Renamed on GitHub to `ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps`. The catalog, overlay and region download addresses use the new name; GitHub redirects the old addresses (checked: `offline-us-maps/releases/download/regions/ca-pe-shortbread-1.0.mbtiles` answers 301 to the new address, then the file), so 0.9.0 and earlier keep downloading.
- **Unchanged.** Project and crate names (`OfflineMaps.*`, `offline-maps-*`), the overlay files' metadata keys (`offline-us-maps:*`, written into published files) and the overview's file name.
- **Tests.** 71 core, 2 HTTP and 6 ABI tests (Rust) and 9 interop tests (C#); the regenerated catalog is identical to the edited one.

Verified: 0.10.0 installed silently over 0.9.0 here. Settings > Apps lists Offline North American Maps 0.10.0 under the same AppId; Start lists "Offline North American Maps" and no longer "Offline US Maps"; started from Start, the window is titled Offline North American Maps; Illinois and Indiana were kept; `tools/acceptance/offline-check.ps1 -Mode online` gave the same results as for 0.9.0.

Released 11 November 2026 as [v0.10.0](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps/releases/tag/v0.10.0), built from 719655e; the installer's SHA-256 (5bc35615…f586cb7b) matches GitHub's digest.

## 0.9.0: Canada, Alaska and Mexico by state

Completed 11 November 2026: stages 2 and 3 of the [North America and Android plan](north-america-and-android.md), and Mexico split by state at Ian's request. Ian chose VersaTiles' Planetiler profile for the built maps and agreed to publishing OpenStreetMap-derived files. Method and figures are in [sources](sources-and-architecture.md#regions-built-for-the-app-from-090).

- **Region files.** In the [`regions` release](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps/releases/tag/regions): 32 Mexican state maps and extracts (1.44 GB), 13 Canadian maps with Nunavut as two (`ca-nu-w`, `ca-nu-e`; one file would have been 3.0 GB, over GitHub's 2 GiB limit) and Alaska (8.9 GB together; Quebec 1.7 GB is the largest). GitHub's SHA-256 digests match the local files.
- **Catalog.** 100 regions: 53 US (Alaska included), 14 Canadian, Mexico whole and its 32 states. The catalog message now carries download addresses, and the Regions window credits maps prepared for the app.
- **Profile comparison** (Rhode Island against Geofabrik's package): Planetiler's bundled Shortbread sample wrote no boundary lines and fewer addresses and labels; VersaTiles' profile writes boundaries and, in the app's style, draws the same roads, street names and shields.
- **Overview.** Canada's provinces, highways and cities (4.2 MB, 100 state and province labels); the view reaches 83.5° N.
- **Search.** French street abbreviations and service words; capitals read "State or provincial capital".
- **Tests.** 71 core, 2 HTTP and 6 ABI tests (Rust) and 9 interop tests (C#).

Verified, downloading from the published files:
- Querétaro (development build, fresh profile): map 12 MB, extract 13 MB (266 fuel stations, 6,898 addresses), terrain 60 MB, in 46 s; map with terrain, contours, fuel stations and the 57D shield.
- New Brunswick (development build): map 83 MB from the release, stations and addresses from Geofabrik (427 fuel, 193 charging stations, 61,862 addresses), terrain 377 MB, in about 2 minutes; "fredericton", "moncton", "essence", "pharmacie", "boul", "rue main" and "123 main st moncton" found what they should; Moncton drawn with streets, buildings and stations.
- Alaska (installed 0.9.0, separate profile on drive D): map 427 MB and stations and addresses (286 fuel stations, 15,631 addresses) in 84 s; Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks found and drawn.

Released 11 November 2026 as [v0.9.0](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps/releases/tag/v0.9.0), built from 29d0a5d; the installer's SHA-256 (b0de39df…de3d6c9) matches GitHub's digest. 0.9.0 installed over 0.8.0 here: Settings > Apps lists 0.9.0, Illinois and Indiana were kept, the app started from its Start entry, and `tools/acceptance/offline-check.ps1 -Mode online` gave the same Illinois results.

Not covered: a download of every built region (Nunavut's halves, Quebec and Ontario were built and published but not downloaded through the app); terrain for the northern regions. Not done: provincial and Trans-Canada shields; Inuktitut syllabics; Mexican-style addresses; a schedule for rebuilding the region files.

## 0.8.0: Mexico

Completed 11 November 2026: stage 1 of the [North America and Android plan](north-america-and-android.md). Details of the data are in [sources](sources-and-architecture.md#mexico-080).

- **Catalog.** Mexico is the 53rd region (`mx`). `tools/make-regions.py` was rerun with fresh sizes for every region (inputs measured 11 November: HEAD sizes, terrain sizes from Mapterhorn's index with the new `offline-maps-dev terrain-size`, and extract boxes from the new `tools/extract-boxes.py`).
- **Fault found in every release since 0.2.0.** A raw extract's header box must lie inside the region's outer box, which was the index outline's box widened by half a degree. Geofabrik cuts the extracts with boundaries that reach further: for 16 states (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota) and Mexico, Download stations and addresses would have failed with "The OpenStreetMap extract does not match". Only Illinois and Indiana had been downloaded before. The outer boxes now also take in each extract's header box; a range request for the first 64 KB of all 53 extracts confirms every one fits, and a test keeps Michigan, Kansas, Hawaii and Mexico in.
- **Size limits.** The cap on one download was 2 GiB (Mexico's map is 1.92 GB) and on one region's terrain 4 GiB (Mexico's is 4.59 GB). They are now 8 GiB and 16 GiB; the free-space check before each download is unchanged.
- **Regions window.** Regions are listed under country headings (United States, then Canada when it has regions, then Mexico); the filter also matches the country's name. The flood zones and public lands command is not shown for Mexico, whose details say they cover US regions only.
- **Search.** Accents are folded when names are compared; Spanish street abbreviations and Spanish words for fuel, pharmacies, police, fire stations, drinking water, toilets, shelters and campgrounds are understood. A city or capital containing every word of the query is a strong match, and villages come after cities and towns even with an exact name, so "queretaro" lists Santiago de Querétaro (the state capital) before a village called Querétaro in Chiapas.
- **Overview and shields.** The overview covers Mexico (3.8 MB); `MEX` federal routes have their own shield.
- **Tests.** 71 core (new: accents and Spanish words, the Querétaro ranking, extract boxes), 2 HTTP and 6 ABI tests (Rust); the app builds with no warnings.

Verified in the development build with a separate profile on drive D (`--settings`), downloading from Geofabrik and Mapterhorn through the Regions window: the map (1,919 MB in about 4 minutes, then its search index in about 2 minutes: 2.5 million entries, 520 MB); stations and addresses (648 MB; 9,189 fuel and 105 charging stations, 1,090,066 addresses, 992 shelters, 485 drinking water points, 546 campgrounds, 1,872 toilets); terrain (4,585 MB in about 13 minutes). The first attempts failed as described above (the extract box, then the terrain cap) and passed after the fixes. Searches: "queretaro" (Santiago de Querétaro first, map drawn with terrain, contours, fuel stations and the 57D shield), "ciudad de mexico", "av insurgentes" (Avenida Insurgentes, MEX 85), "gasolinera" (Pemex stations with addresses), "farmacia", "222 paseo de la reforma" (the address), "monterrey". The overview at first start shows Mexico's states, highways and border.

Not done: Mexico by state (Geofabrik publishes one file for the country; separate states need self-built tiles, as Canada does), addresses written with the number after the street ("Reforma 222" finds places named so, not the address), and Mexican state route shields.

Released 11 November 2026 as [v0.8.0](https://github.com/ianrastall/offline-north-american-maps/releases/tag/v0.8.0), built from 92e3fd9; the installer's SHA-256 (67752d95…94a3f1f1) matches GitHub's digest. 0.8.0 installed over 0.7.1 here: Settings > Apps lists 0.8.0, Illinois and Indiana were kept, the app started from its Start entry, and `tools/acceptance/offline-check.ps1 -Mode online` gave the same Illinois results as for 0.7.1. The release build needs `pwsh -NoProfile` with `DOTNET_ROOT` cleared, since the user profile points it at an SDK folder without the pinned 10.0.114.

## Offline acceptance test

Passed 11 November 2026 with the installed 0.7.1. This is the first workflow's decisive test: the app started with no network and did everything from local files.

- **Data.** Installed earlier through the app from Geofabrik: the Illinois map (`illinois-shortbread-1.0.mbtiles`, 9 November build, SHA-256 fb6876ce…) and its stations and addresses (`illinois-latest.osm.pbf` of 8 November: 3,415 fuel, 432 charging, 843,142 addresses). Indiana, Illinois terrain and Illinois flood zones and public lands were also installed; saved places held "Home".
- **No network.** Ian switched Airplane mode on. Before launch and again at the end the script found no network adapter up apart from Hyper-V's virtual switches, no connection profile with internet, and a TCP connection to 1.1.1.1:443 failing. It changes no network settings itself.
- **Method.** `tools/acceptance/offline-check.ps1` (Windows PowerShell 5.1) waits for the network to go, closes any running copy and starts `OfflineMaps.exe` from the install folder as a new process. It drives the window through UI Automation, takes page screenshots through WebView2's DevTools port on loopback (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`, only for this process, with `tools/acceptance/cdp.mjs`) and samples TCP connections of the app and its WebView2 processes. When it finishes it restores `settings.json`, says so in a message box and waits for the network to return. `-Mode online` runs the same check without waiting.
- **Results, offline.** The window opened in 1 s and the map page in 2 s. The status bar read "Illinois and Indiana maps, data of 9 November 2026 · stations and addresses", and no error bar was shown. The map drew roads, labels, route shields, buildings, contour lines, hillshading, flood shading, public lands, fuel stations, drinking water and shelters, with the credits line.
  - "springfield": 50 results headed by the state capital (186 mi); selecting it moved the map to Springfield at zoom 11, fully drawn with I‑55 and I‑72 shields and fuel stations.
  - "1060 w addison st chicago": one address result; selecting it showed Wrigley Field at zoom 18.
  - "fuel", "campground", "drinking water" and "charging": 50 results each, nearest first, with towns and street addresses ("Shell. Fuel station · near Lake View · 0.4 mi · 801 West Addison Street, Chicago").
  - Clearing the search listed the saved places again; selecting "Home" returned the map to it. `saved-places.json` was unchanged.
  - Remote TCP connections from the app's process tree: none. The map page requested nothing outside `https://map.local/`. The app log gained no lines.
- **Same check online** (just before): identical results. WebView2's own processes held connections to Microsoft and to Comcast's DNS-over-HTTPS service; none were needed, as the offline run shows.

Observed: the installed Illinois flood zones and public lands are the local test build of 8 November (built 00:08 UTC 9 November, installed from a local server), from before easements lost their labels, so programme codes such as "Crep 20010796" are drawn around Springfield. The published file is a later build (different SHA-256, same size), and Check for updates already lists it as newer.

Not covered: Indiana's search and map, a cold start after a reboot, toggling layers while offline and a clean machine. `navigator.onLine` stayed true, because Hyper-V's virtual adapters stay up; the page does not depend on it.

## Next stages

1. Accessibility and appearance review: keyboard order, screen reader names, high contrast, text scaling, the light theme and mixed-DPI monitors.
2. Install on a clean Windows 11 machine.
3. If town attribution near municipal lines proves wrong in use, assign towns from administrative boundaries (`admin_level=8`) in the extract instead of settlement points.

After the offline acceptance test, the work continues with the [North America and Android plan](north-america-and-android.md) (agreed 10 November 2026): Mexico, a tile build for Canada and Alaska, a rename, then the Android app.
